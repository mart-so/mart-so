- 🌍 Based in Río de la Plata, and passionate about create innovative tech things.

- 💼 Currently working as a Software Engineer with a strong focus on Full Stack Development.

- 💻 My coding journey started when I was 6 years old with "Logo Writer v2. MS-DOS" at primary school. Then I delved into HTML for a couple of years by creating games for web browsers just for fun. I started Medical School, but I got an Arduino and fell in love with tech again. So, I enrolled in Engineering College for a few years to learn the basics. It has been around 7 years now that I've been collaborating with tech companies as a Full Stack developer.

- 🏢 I've collaborated with prominent companies like Technisys, IOVLabs( Taringa! ), Elevate MLS, and Rackspace Technology.

- 🛠️ Proficient in a wide range of technologies, including JavaScript, Node.js, ReactJS, Typescript, Docker, and more.

- 🎓 I keep learning base on suggested path from Platzi, a platform that I found more efficient for learn than the University, anyway I have strong background in both Electronic Engineering and Computing Science Engineering from Universidad de la República (UDELAR)
  
- 📚 My expertise includes Full Stack Development, Agile Team Management, and more.

- 🎨 I also have a keen interest in electronics, having worked on various personal projects involving Arduino, CNC, RC planes, and more.
